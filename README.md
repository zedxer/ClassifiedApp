Classified Application for assessment

Application is written on Kotlin and 1 class has been written on JAVA for the sake of bonus points, since application contain KTX function thats why I have preferred kotlin over java in many cases.

The Caching library has been added in the project, has been forked from other source. You can find the source in my Github repo.

Currently in this application there is not proper testing and test cases has been written, I have no hands-on, on it. I have done what I could by the duration of this test.
